2022 Sales Decline: The sharp drop in sales in 2022 (likely due to COVID-19 impacts) but recovered significantly in 2021 and remained strong in 2022 is a significant concern that requires immediate investigation to identify the root cause and reverse the trend.

### Opportunity:
- High-Profit Liberica: The high-profit margin of Liberica coffee presents a clear opportunity. A focused marketing strategy to increase the sales volume of Liberica could substantially boost overall profitability. Thus, Arabica drives volume; Liberica drives margin. A blended strategy can optimize revenue and profitability.
- Loyalty Program Enhancement: With over half of the sales coming from non-loyalty customers, there is a significant opportunity to grow the loyalty program. Enhancing the program's benefits could improve customer retention and increase lifetime value.
- International Growth: While the U.S. is the core market, the existing sales in Ireland and the United Kingdom indicate a potential for international expansion.
